-- I want to only know the first name, last name and birthday of an employee when entering an employee number.

drop procedure if exists emp_bday;

create procedure emp_bday(in employee_number int)

begin 
	select first_name, last_name, birth_date 
    from employees 
    where emp_no = employee_number;
